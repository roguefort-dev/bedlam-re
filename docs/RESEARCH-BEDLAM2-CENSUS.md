# Bedlam 2: Absolute Bedlam — acquisition + compatibility census (2026-08-17)

- File: Bedlam_2_-_Absolute_Bedlam_1997.zip (33,011,792 B)
  sha256: see ~/Backups/bedlam2/bedlam2.zip.sha256
- Scene release per CLASS.NFO: Absolute Bedlam (c) GT Interactive, released
  1997-11-02 by CLASS (supplier TALENT UK). File dates 1996-12-24 (dev build).
  Never officially released (unfinished game); this is a cracked retail-preview rip.
- Backup: ~/Backups/bedlam2/ (zip + hash). Staged at game-data-2/ (gitignored,
  MANIFEST-2.sha256 verified).

## Completeness verdict
Cross-check of every data filename referenced in 8street/Bedlam2 sources (150
literals) against the rip: only SAVED.BDL + HISCORE.BDL absent = runtime-created
save files. The rip is COMPLETE w.r.t. everything the code loads. Missing
MISSION5.* in 5 of 6 zones + scattered gaps = authentic unfinished-build state
(8street: "some level files seem were never created"), not rip damage.

## Census (game-data-2, 989 files, tools/inspect unmodified; re-verified 2026-08-17 with current tooling, see re-census section)
- BIN sprite banks: 191/191 parse, 11,008 PNGs — SAME RLE16 + dir format as B1
- CGR tile banks: 36/36 parse, 4,608 tiles — SAME dual codec (raw/byterle)
- MAP/TOT/COL grid16: 102/102; DAT grid8: 34/34; 34 plane0 map renders
- TRT/MRK/POS/PAD/PTH/NME/BDG: 34 each — same table formats
- RAW pcm8: 106; PAL: 83 (+ 10 variants); TRN: 16; SMK: 5; MIN 7; LNK/LNG 43+7
- BDL: 2 parsed = both OPTIONS.BDL (root + MIRAGE/AB_BED byte-dupe);
  2 unknown-variant = both CONFIG.BDL 61B (root 67bba211 + MIRAGE 4a805ec9)
- 90.0% parse (890/989) with ZERO Bedlam-2-specific code

## Re-census 2026-08-17 23:0x (after the music-decoder promotion)
Re-ran tools/inspect over game-data-2 -> derived-2 now that the mrs arm
is a real dumper (7325d23 + 3530a1b) and diffed against the 04:30
stub-era summary: BYTE-IDENTICAL (989 files, 0 breakdown and 0 per-file
status diffs). decode-song has no B2 input: the corpus contains ZERO
.MRS/.MRW files - SOUND/MIDI/ exists but is an EMPTY directory (0
entries; absent from MANIFEST-2 because sha256 manifests cannot list
empty dirs). The mrs/mrw arms are therefore provably no-ops on B2.
Same run refreshed the stale B1 census (derived/ dated 02:40, still
mrs:partial): now mrs:parsed 5/5 + mrw:parsed 5/5 with loop ticks
331/400/1476/1600/3388 == the RE-EXW-MUSIC.md 3b invariants; B1 =
950/1069 (88.9%) parsed vs B2 890/989 (90.0%). MANIFEST.sha256 and
MANIFEST-2.sha256 both verified OK before AND after the runs.
[provenance: derived*/summary.json diff + sha256 manifests; confidence: high]

## Divergences vs Bedlam 1 (data layer)
- 6 zones (A-F) vs 7; missions per zone differ; MISSION5 mostly absent
- No MRW/MRS music scores (SOUND/MIDI/ present but EMPTY); audio = 106
  RAW = 92 SFX + 14 LOOPS. LOOPS names overlap the B1 MRS song slots
  (DEBRIEF/OPTIONS/SHOP plus numbered variants; B1 additionally has
  BRIEF/SELECT) => B2 ships screen music as PCM8 loops instead of MRS
  synth [confidence: moderate, name-overlap only]. LOOPS/OPTIONS.RAW is
  byte-identical to OPTIONS1.RAW (sha 165539d1...). + HMI .386 drivers
- Single LANGUAGE.ENG (no multi-language set)
- DOS exe only (BEDLAM.EXE 672KB LE/Watcom + DOS4GW) — no Win95 build in this rip
- UNIVBE/UVCONFIG + SETUP present (VESA SVGA 480p-1440p native support)
- New: editor MISSION?.BIN zone banks inside EDITOR/ZONE? dirs
- MIRAGE/AB_BED/ = second Absolute-Bedlam config dir: OPTIONS.BDL
  byte-identical dupe of root (a6b970e9...); CONFIG.BDL same 61B layout
  but DIFFERENT bytes (4a805ec9 vs 67bba211 = two frozen SB setups);
  BEDLAM.LOG zero-length (both LOGs are the empty-file sha e3b0c442...)
- pending:queued 3 = scene/util payload only, no loader warranted:
  CLASS.NFO, GAMEGFX/CHKLIST.MS, UNIVBE.INI
- PAL 256B-variant set grows vs B1: DARKPAL/DARKPALS/SELDARK (same as
  B1) + B2-only DARKPALT.PAL and BRF_TX.PAL; the 65536B (TXPAL1-3) and
  98B (CONSPAL/FULLPAL) variant sets are identical by name

## Implications
1. bedlam-assets transfers nearly 1:1 — same formats, second corpus for fuzz/coverage
2. Second RE target: BEDLAM.EXE (DOS canon, same HMI stack) for logic divergence
3. Engine must parameterize content (zones/missions/units), not hardcode B1 counts
