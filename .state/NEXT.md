# NEXT - task queue (top first; rewrite this file at end of every run)

QUEUE CONVENTION (2026-08-22, D106): a completed unit's entry MOVES to
the '## Done' log at end of run - never stays in '## Now' as 'N. DONE ...'
(the scheduler mechanically skips a first-word DONE marker, but the
renumbered queue keeps every open item claimable by number).
AUTHORING RULE (D180, second recurrence after D177): every
[status]/[id]/[gate]/[probe]/[retry] metadata tag stays WHOLE on the
item's first numbered line, prose starting same-line after the tags —
never wrap INSIDE a tag; the strict parser rejects it (rc=2,
INVALID-DEADLOCKED) and the worker dies at its own finish line.
## Now
1. [READY] [id=p5-phase-close] [gate=p5-phase-close] P5
   phase-close bookkeeping — the ledger reads 37/37 (D199: every
   shipped mission green, every zone closed; the p5-zone-g gate is
   wired, 16 gates all-green at 65505ea), so P5's remaining work is
   the PHASE-CLOSE ONLY (the p4-phase-status-green pattern, commit
   972748d precedent): flip the P5 phase status pending->green in
   docs/required-gates.toml (P0-P5 green, P6-P7 pending;
   plan_complete stays false exactly as designed), commit, then
   re-emit the bound phase verdict at the new HEAD with the exact
   P4-shaped command: /usr/bin/python3 tools/validate-required-gates.py
   --root . --report .state/p5-gates-report.json --phase P5
   --phase-output .state/P5-COMPLETE (all 8 P5 required gates must
   be green at the flip commit under the validator's bwrap
   containment; .state/P5-COMPLETE phase-complete-v1 re-bound to
   the flip commit + manifest sha256, producer=required-gates-
   validator, emitted by the validator itself). Update the
   .state/STATE.md phase line, then queue the first P6 unit from
   docs/PLAN.md section 6 so required work stays active. Bounds:
   docs+state-only commit; .state/STATE.md is an s0-dispositions
   tracked path — park uncommitted STATE.md edits while running
   the HEAD-bound battery (the D193/D194 lesson); MANIFEST clean;
   no Ghidra run; Nudge-Worker trailer.
## Done
1. DONE (2026-08-28, claim 1 — substantive commits 0829187 + 65505ea
   by worker ebf6cfca, both PUSHED): P5 `p5-zone-g-disposition` —
   ZONE G CLOSED, THE LEDGER READS 37/37: the LAST ledger mission
   flips green and P5's mission side is DONE (D199); the disposition
   is the FIFTH PURE ZONES-APPEND (the §9..§12 shape) with the ONE
   census-forced seam delta. (a) THE APPEND (0829187): the ZONEG
   ZoneSpec joined the ZONES list after B, C, D, E, F (letter G,
   missions 1..=1, dims 100x25 — the census-pinned NON-SQUARE
   mission, TOT 40004 B re-verified first-hand; committed flows
   NONE) and the SELECT write-pair legs of zone_t1_rules_spot now
   derive from the zone's own mission range (zone G's zone cell 7
   is OUTSIDE the SELECT write arm's 2..=6 domain and no MP file
   ships for G, §7j.73 — zones B..=F exercise the identical legs
   they always did; the write-arm reject domain still checks (7,1)
   loud); the battery: P5GM1A/B/C all 3 flows full declared budgets
   (3/121/49 records), dumps verify, two-run byte identity — NO
   engine gap on the ZONEG mission; zones B (21 + the committed
   S5/S5B/S5C), C (21), D (21), E (21) and F (21) re-verified in
   place. (b) THE FLIP (65505ea, the cross-artifact rule): ledger
   ZONEG-MISSION1 green (catalog_refs = []), the ledger 37/37
   (A 1/1, B..F 7/7 each, G 1/1 — EVERY shipped mission green);
   P5-ZONE-GATES §13 criterion table (linear = m+24, M1 = 25 one
   below the clamp ceiling; the zone-level MISSIONG.BIN 2443943 B
   fetch-chain pin with NO variant caveat — zone G ships no
   mission-number variant bank; the real 1144 B .NME bank; the
   zone-A-shaped DM carve-out); the p5-zone-g gate joins P5
   required_gates (16 gates); the ledger test pin re-baselined
   36/37 to 37/37 + the ZONEG 1/1 line (deliberate, same commit);
   D199. Verified first-hand at the flip commit: ledger OK 37/37 +
   ZONEG 1/1, hermetic 18/18, strict queue parser rc=0,
   zone_mission_parity 5/5 (six zones, 27.43s), canonical_dump_gate
   13/13 zero chain movement, differ_gate 4/4, determinism 4/4,
   mission_load_census green (census stays 37/37), bedlam-core
   hash_fixture + mission_corpus_gate green, fmt + clippy clean on
   the touched crate (the 7 bedlam-core warnings pre-exist from
   D151, untouched), the HEAD-bound validator battery ALL 16 GATES
   PASSED at 65505ea (bounded, offline, incl. p5-zone-g's both
   commands rc=0; the global report's status=failed/plan_complete=
   false is ONLY the pending P5-P7 phase-status semantics, not a
   gate failure — the same documented ZONEB note), MANIFEST clean
   before and after every corpus read, no Ghidra run. Queued: the
   P5 phase-close disposition as the new head (the P4 pattern).
