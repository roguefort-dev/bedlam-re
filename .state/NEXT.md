# NEXT - task queue (top first; rewrite this file at end of every run)

QUEUE CONVENTION (2026-08-22, D106): a completed unit's entry MOVES to
the '## Done' log at end of run - never stays in '## Now' as 'N. DONE ...'
(the scheduler mechanically skips a first-word DONE marker, but the
renumbered queue keeps every open item claimable by number).
AUTHORING RULE (D180, second recurrence after D177): every
[status]/[id]/[gate]/[probe]/[retry] metadata tag stays WHOLE on the
item's first numbered line, prose starting same-line after the tags —
never wrap INSIDE a tag; the strict parser rejects it (rc=2,
INVALID-DEADLOCKED) and the worker dies at its own finish line.
## Now
1. [READY] [id=p6-modernization-scaffold] [gate=p6-modernization-scaffold] P6
   opener per PLAN §6 (Modernization — default modern, classic
   available) — land the P6 decision surface + the FIRST P6
   required gate (the D175 p5-zone-gate-scaffold pattern: the
   machine-checkable contract lands BEFORE any behavior change;
   the P6 required_gates list is currently empty and the P6 phase
   status stays pending until its gates close). (a) DECISIONS.md
   entry deciding the ModeConfig seam per PLAN §6 verbatim:
   classic mode shrinks to a small purist toggle set covering
   FEEL-CONTESTED items only (timing lock, control scheme,
   selected original-behavior catalog entries classified for
   preservation by a deterministic rubric and decision record,
   with regression tests); mode is ONE immutable ModeConfig
   injected at sim construction; the test surface is the purist
   toggles, never the full feature cross-product. (b) Commit
   docs/P6-MODERNIZATION.md: the bug-triage rubric VERBATIM from
   PLAN §6 (crash/data-loss is fixed everywhere; gameplay-coupled
   is classic-preserves and modern-fixes; cosmetic is fixed in
   modern) plus the original-behavior catalog format that the P5
   ledger catalog_refs feed — all 37 missions closed green with
   EMPTY refs, so the seeding policy is part of the decision
   (divergence-recorded entries only, or broader observed
   original behaviors worth classifying). (c) The committed
   catalog artifact + its fail-closed checker + hermetic test
   suite wired as the FIRST P6 required_gates entry in
   docs/required-gates.toml; the gates-validator suite must stay
   green (re-run tools/test-validate-required-gates.py; the
   validator's strict manifest key schema applies to the new
   gate). Bounds: no engine change, no harness change; controls
   green before AND after (check-p5-zone-ledger 37/37,
   zone_mission_parity, canonical_dump_gate); MANIFEST clean
   before and after any corpus read; no Ghidra run; commit with
   the unit's own Nudge-Worker trailer.
## Done
1. DONE (2026-08-28, claim 1 — commit f608207 by worker ec090fa6,
   PUSHED, plus this bookkeeping commit): P5 phase-close
   bookkeeping `p5-phase-close` — the P5 phase status FLIPPED
   pending->green in docs/required-gates.toml (P0-P5 green,
   P6-P7 pending; plan_complete correctly stays false), then the
   bound phase verdict RE-EMITTED at the flip commit with the
   exact P4-shaped command: /usr/bin/python3
   tools/validate-required-gates.py --root . --report
   .state/p5-gates-report.json --phase P5 --phase-output
   .state/P5-COMPLETE — ALL 8 P5 GATES GREEN at f608207 (report
   status=passed, bounded, offline, containment
   bwrap-unshare-net-pid-ro, every command rc=0;
   .state/P5-COMPLETE phase-complete-v1 re-bound to the flip
   commit + manifest sha256 7efb1041..., producer
   required-gates-validator, emitted by the validator itself).
   Pre-flip first-hand checks: check-p5-zone-ledger OK — the
   ledger reads 37/37 (A 1/1, B..F 7/7 each, G 1/1) and the P5
   status-green cross-artifact rule holds; the tracked tree
   stayed clean through the whole HEAD-bound battery (the
   D193/D194 lesson — STATE.md/NEXT.md edits parked until
   after); MANIFEST clean before AND after every corpus read; no
   Ghidra run. The queue now carries the P6 opener as the head
   (the p4-phase-close/5347a37 pattern): p6-modernization-scaffold
   per PLAN §6, so required work stays active.
2. DONE (2026-08-28, claim 1 — substantive commits 0829187 + 65505ea
   by worker ebf6cfca, both PUSHED): P5 `p5-zone-g-disposition` —
   ZONE G CLOSED, THE LEDGER READS 37/37: the LAST ledger mission
   flips green and P5's mission side is DONE (D199); the disposition
   is the FIFTH PURE ZONES-APPEND (the §9..§12 shape) with the ONE
   census-forced seam delta. (a) THE APPEND (0829187): the ZONEG
   ZoneSpec joined the ZONES list after B, C, D, E, F (letter G,
   missions 1..=1, dims 100x25 — the census-pinned NON-SQUARE
   mission, TOT 40004 B re-verified first-hand; committed flows
   NONE) and the SELECT write-pair legs of zone_t1_rules_spot now
   derive from the zone's own mission range (zone G's zone cell 7
   is OUTSIDE the SELECT write arm's 2..=6 domain and no MP file
   ships for G, §7j.73 — zones B..=F exercise the identical legs
   they always did; the write-arm reject domain still checks (7,1)
   loud); the battery: P5GM1A/B/C all 3 flows full declared budgets
   (3/121/49 records), dumps verify, two-run byte identity — NO
   engine gap on the ZONEG mission; zones B (21 + the committed
   S5/S5B/S5C), C (21), D (21), E (21) and F (21) re-verified in
   place. (b) THE FLIP (65505ea, the cross-artifact rule): ledger
   ZONEG-MISSION1 green (catalog_refs = []), the ledger 37/37
   (A 1/1, B..F 7/7 each, G 1/1 — EVERY shipped mission green);
   P5-ZONE-GATES §13 criterion table (linear = m+24, M1 = 25 one
   below the clamp ceiling; the zone-level MISSIONG.BIN 2443943 B
   fetch-chain pin with NO variant caveat — zone G ships no
   mission-number variant bank; the real 1144 B .NME bank; the
   zone-A-shaped DM carve-out); the p5-zone-g gate joins P5
   required_gates (16 gates); the ledger test pin re-baselined
   36/37 to 37/37 + the ZONEG 1/1 line (deliberate, same commit);
   D199. Verified first-hand at the flip commit: ledger OK 37/37 +
   ZONEG 1/1, hermetic 18/18, strict queue parser rc=0,
   zone_mission_parity 5/5 (six zones, 27.43s), canonical_dump_gate
   13/13 zero chain movement, differ_gate 4/4, determinism 4/4,
   mission_load_census green (census stays 37/37), bedlam-core
   hash_fixture + mission_corpus_gate green, fmt + clippy clean on
   the touched crate (the 7 bedlam-core warnings pre-exist from
   D151, untouched), the HEAD-bound validator battery ALL 16 GATES
   PASSED at 65505ea (bounded, offline, incl. p5-zone-g's both
   commands rc=0; the global report's status=failed/plan_complete=
   false is ONLY the pending P5-P7 phase-status semantics, not a
   gate failure — the same documented ZONEB note), MANIFEST clean
   before and after every corpus read, no Ghidra run. Queued: the
   P5 phase-close disposition as the new head (the P4 pattern).
